# SESSION_LOG.md — Persistent Memory

> Newest entry on top. Claude: update this at the end of every working session
> (or when the user runs `/session-save`, or before context gets long).
> Keep entries short and factual — this file is what future sessions read first.
> Prune entries older than ~20 sessions into `docs/archive/SESSION_LOG-<year>.md`.

## Format for each entry

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary>

**Done:** what was completed and verified (with file paths)
**In progress:** what is half-finished and exactly where it stands
**Blocked / open questions:** anything waiting on the user or an external factor
**Decisions:** link to DECISIONS.md entries added this session
**Gotchas learned:** non-obvious things discovered (env quirks, flaky tests, API surprises)
**Next steps:** the first 1–3 things the next session should do
```

## 2026-07-24 — DB platform switch: Supabase → Amazon RDS; docs aligned

**Done:** Owner decision (2026-07-24) recorded and propagated: the database moves
from Supabase to **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16** in `ca-central-1` (VPC-private,
RDS Proxy at launch, KMS/gp3, backups + PITR); Better Auth re-confirmed after a
Cognito comparison; TypeScript backend re-confirmed. Canonical ADRs already
amended in `../kia-tracker-specs/docs/new/00-overview/ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md`
(ADR-004 Socket.IO realtime, ADR-006 note, ADR-008 RDS, ADR-013 S3/CloudFront,
ADR-014/015/023 + stack table). Docs aligned this session: kia-tracker-specs —
`EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` (target stack table), `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 0 item 0.7 RDS
via IaC, realtime rows, envelope restated), `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` +
`OPEN-QUESTIONS-SIMPLE.md` (Q-08 cost table → RDS + S3 rows, envelope
~US$750–1,100/mo; Q-11 update notes), `functional-requirements.md` +
`non-functional-requirements.md` (Socket.IO/S3/RDS Proxy where Supabase was the
target), `README.md` (05-database description); main-project — `PROJECT.md`
(stack facts), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (overview + mermaid + data flow),
`DECISIONS.md` (D-013/D-014/D-015), `TASKS.md` (A-04 re-scoped to local Docker
Postgres + staging RDS via A-07 IaC).
**In progress:** nothing — still pre-build.
**Blocked / open questions:** unchanged — client answers pending in
`../kia-tracker-specs/docs/new/00-overview/CLIENT-QUESTIONS.md`; none block Phase 0.
**Decisions:** D-013 (RDS over Supabase), D-014 (Better Auth re-confirmed vs
Cognito), D-015 (TypeScript backend re-confirmed) in docs/DECISIONS.md.
**Gotchas learned:** Supabase mentions in legacy/as-is descriptions (old Kia
tracker, leaked-key rotation, audit findings) are intentional history — do not
"fix" them; realtime is now app-emitted Socket.IO events (no DB change-capture),
so emitters must tenant-scope every payload; there is no service-role key
anywhere in the target architecture; dev needs zero cloud resources (local
Docker Postgres).
**Next steps:** unchanged — (1) Ahmad A-01 scaffold; (2) Hussein H-01 Stitch
round; (3) both read the newest SESSION_LOG entry + PROJECT.md before starting.

## 2026-07-23 — Setup session: plan locked, scaffold adapted, ready for Phase 0

**Done:** Planning phase complete — 57 docs in `../kia-tracker-specs/docs/new/`
(canonical authority: `00-overview/ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md`, 26 ADRs amended
2026-07-23 with owner decisions). Owner decisions locked and logged (D-001…D-012).
Scaffold adapted to ReadyLoans: `docs/PROJECT.md` (identity, stack, planned
commands, conventions, boundaries, quality bar), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (target
system map), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (founding ADRs + 11 owner decisions),
`docs/SECURITY.md` (baseline, threat model, deferred-legal-review risk),
`README.md` (repo↔plan relationship). No code exists yet.
**In progress:** nothing — pre-build.
**Blocked / open questions:** client answers pending in
`../kia-tracker-specs/docs/new/00-overview/CLIENT-QUESTIONS.md` (final product
name, lead volumes, Merlin/CAMS role, ON-vs-QC checklist, wholesale authority);
none block Phase 0.
**Decisions:** D-001…D-012 in docs/DECISIONS.md (adopt 26 ADRs; AWS ca-central-1;
clean-start DB; admin-managed pricing; model-agnostic AI; connector framework;
commercial VIN decode; no Tailwind Plus; Stitch-first design; blue-green deploys;
AI error assistant; two-agent build AHMAD/HUSSEIN).
**Gotchas learned:** `../kia-tracker-specs/` is read-only reference — business
rules live in its code/specs, its data is worthless (never migrate); on any
conflict between older specs and the ADRs, the ADRs win; commands in PROJECT.md
are planned, not real, until A-01 lands.
**Next steps:** (1) Ahmad — A-01: `git init` + pnpm/Turborepo monorepo scaffold
(apps/web, api, workers, intake; packages/db, schemas, contracts, core, ui, i18n,
ai), then correct PROJECT.md commands against reality. (2) Hussein — H-01: Stitch
design round → owner selects the design direction (D-009). (3) Both: read the
newest SESSION_LOG entry + PROJECT.md before starting.
